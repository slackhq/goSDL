### Information Gathering
The fist part of the tool is the information gathering form. The tools generate the form from the JSON blob file `information_gathering.json`.

### Risk Assessment
The second step of the form is the risk assessment questionaire, which determines the project's risk. This is also presented in the form of JSON blob file `riskassessment.json` that is easy to modify.

### Modules
Modules are the content that generate the "component survey". This last segment of the tool requires the Project Lead to select components that are relevant to their project. The modules will determine the necessary checklist for the project. 
Each module will represent a description and checklist that are relevant to the modules.
